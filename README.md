## üöÄ JamStack + üßë‚ÄçüöÄ React + üßë‚Äçüíª Workshop

Welcome to **BattleStax**, a [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) game that uses [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/), [DataStax Astra](https://dtsx.io/workshop), and [GitHub](https://github.com/) to demonstrate how to build and deploy an application using modern, scalable architectures. In this 3 hour workshop you will create your own **BattleStax** game using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) implemented with a CI/CD pipeline, global CDN network, and [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) all using **FREE** tech.

## Project Structure

BattleStax's folder structure is (mostly) generated from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We then add a Netlify Functions and Github Actions.

- .github - [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) configuration
- .storybook - [Storybook Documentation](https://storybook.js.org/) Storybook configuration
- functions - [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) Lambda function definition
- public - Static files
- src - [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) source files

### Prerequisites

-  A Github account - [Github](https://github.com)
-  A fork of the `BattleStax Tutorial` repository - [Repository](https://github.com/kidrecursive/battlestax-tutorial)
- Environment (choose one)
    - **GitPod:** A free, cloud based IDE in **GitHub** which we preconfigure for you (seriously, this is cool)
    - **Local:** NodeJS 12 - [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Recommended alternative: Setup your local development environment with [nodeenv](#nodeenv)
-  A Netlify account (it's free!) - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
-  An Astra account and database (it's free!) - [Astra](https://dtsx.io/workshop)

To get started, use the table of contents and start with **`00. Setup environment and tools`** listed below. You **MUST** complete this step in order to get your enviroment configured for the rest of the workshop. Once that is complete you are free to start from any other step.
